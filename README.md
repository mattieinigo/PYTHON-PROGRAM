# MY PYTHON PROGRAMING LAB ACTIVITIES 
MY PYTHON PROGRAMING LAB ACT.3

In this activity, students will write a function that categorizes a person based on their age using an if-elif-else structure. The function, named classify _age(age), will take an age as input and classify individuals into four groups: Child (0-12 years), Teen (13-19 years), Adult (20-64 years), and Senior (65+ years). If an invalid age (negative number) is entered, the function should print an appropriate message. Students will call this function multiple times with different age values to observe how the program categorizes different individuals. For example, calling classify_age (8) should print "You are a Child.", while classify_age (70) should print "You are a Senior.". This exercise will help students understand function definitions, parameter usage, and conditional statements in Python.
